# Todo-List-Task-1
Task 1 of Coding Samurai Todo list in Python
I have created a Todo list command line application in python for the task of Coding Samurai.
The application is purely written in python 3 and the database is in MySQL

Features : 
+ Add tasks to the list
+ View all tasks
+ mark any task complete
+ delete a task not required

The application can executed at any platform like windows, linux and mac.

some of the modules are not inbuilt so you have to install 
rich module : pip install rich
mysql-connector : pip install mysql-connector and pip install mysql-connector-python
